The gdata_feedfetcher sample illustrates reading AtomPub feeds exposed by
Google Data APIs. When reading from a feed which requires authorization
from the user, this sample uses AuthSub to allow the user to grant access to 
their data. 

In order to run, this sample requires the source code for the 
gdata-python-client to be uploaded along with the code provided
in this sample. You can download the gdata-python-client library here:

http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/downloads/list

Copy the gdata and atom directories which are found in source into the
root directory of your app. 

For an explanation on how the sample works, please see the aricle on this
sample, which is available here:
