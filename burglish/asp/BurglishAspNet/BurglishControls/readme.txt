2. BurglishRichTextBox

Note

Javascript files are needed to update from ../js folders. It is neccessary 
to copy in the build directory so that is embended as web resource in binary file.

burglish.js has been brench out from main js file. Developer need to update both for logic changes. 
Current it is ad hoc brench to save development time. Will be merge back later.
